# Places

If your looking for places to edit, locations that have already had their sectors located can be found on the Wolvenkit wiki [here.](https://wiki.redmodding.org/wolvenkit/guides/modding-community/exporting-streaming-sectors-to-blender/interesting-sectors)

The CET wiki has a list of interesting locations for teleport [here.](https://wiki.redmodding.org/cyber-engine-tweaks/teleportation-locations)

The [AMM Discord](https://discord.com/invite/47jV2rNdgn) has an entire channel dedicated to finding interesting places. Join up and have a look.

Once you have locations you can edit them following the guides by Kratoes in the [World Editing ](../../modding-guides/world-editing/)section of this wiki, or export them to Blender by following the [guide ](https://wiki.redmodding.org/wolvenkit/guides/modding-community/exporting-streaming-sectors-to-blender)over on the Wolvenkit wiki.

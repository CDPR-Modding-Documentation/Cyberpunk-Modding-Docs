This page explains how the level of detail is handled in environment files.

### Wait, this is not what I want!

* To learn how components (equipment) casts shadows, check [meshes-shadows-and-shadow-meshes.md](../3d-objects-.mesh-files/meshes-shadows-and-shadow-meshes.md "mention")

## Auto-hiding

Many world objects are automatically hidden if you move away from them, freeing the engine resources that had been used to render them.

{% hint style="info" %}
Hiding an object will also hide its shadows and occluders.
{% endhint %}

The distance at which this happens is controlled by the `forceAutoHideDistance` property of each world node:

This probably corresponds directly to the `nearAutoHideDistance` in the proxy mesh ndoes below?

## Proxy meshes

There is a specialized node type for world proxy meshes: the `worldGenericProxyMeshNode`.  (Which raises the question if there are specialized / extended `worldXXProxyMeshNodes?)`

What you’ll need :\


* [Noesis](https://richwhitehouse.com/index.php?content=inc\_projects.php\&showproject=91)
* [WolvenKit](https://github.com/WolvenKit/WolvenKit/releases) or the extracted game files
* Photoshop / Art program

I’ll assume you already know some basic modding\
(extracting the files with the console or WKit etc)

First of you’ll need to create your mod folder, it should look like this

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/3)

This is where the Loading screen image are stocked, so go in that exact same folder in your Game Extracts!

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/4 (1)>)

Depending on the resolution you’re using, you’ll have to edit either the **4k** files or the **4k\_1080p** files

I personally need the 4k files ; There is **13 loading screens** in total, and you’ll need the .tga .dds and .xbm files for each one, meaning **39 files** in total in your mod folder

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/5)

Now open Photoshop, and edit the .tga files with your screenshots!

You’ll notice that the loading pics are vertically swapped;\
**be sure to also vertically swap your pics so that it’ll look normal in game**

Once you’re done editing all **13 .tga files**, you save them

We now open Noesis, and navigate to our mod folder

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/8 (2)>)

You’ll need to Right Click on your .tga files and select Export, and change the **Main Output Type to .xbm**

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/9 (2)>)

Click export, you should see a pop up window; simply click OK

Once you’re done exporting all your 13 .tga files to .xbm, you can delete the .tga files from the mod folder _(or keep them somewhere else! remember to put them back in the mod folder to export them if you do want to edit them later)_

You should now have 52 files - the originals and your exported .xbm with “out” at the end of the name. Delete the originals and rename your exported .xbm to take out the “out” !

Then you’re left with 26 files, it should look like that :

We now open CP77 Tools / Wolvenkit Console ! We need to rebuild the .xbm files

**cp77tools import -p \[PATH] –keep**

**Pack your mod and test it!**

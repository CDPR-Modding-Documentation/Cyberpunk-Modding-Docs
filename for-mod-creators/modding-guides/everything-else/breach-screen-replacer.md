# Breach Screen - Replacer

## Tools needed:

* WolvenKit
* RAD Video Tools
* Your own custom video (bear in  mind that the video file is limited to 10 seconds and it will play on a loop)

## Convert your MP4 video file

Download and install _RAD Video Tools_ (no special assistance with this as its straight forward)

* Open _RAD Video Tools_ and browse your _video file_ that that will replace the _Breach Screen_

* Click Done and you have your own video converted to bk2 format and ready to replace the original one

## WolvenKit New Project

* &#x20;Open WolvenKit and create a new project
* From right side of WolvenKit window select Asset Browser
* Find _splash\_logo.bk2_ in the following location:

```
base\movies\fullscreen\e3_2020_loading\
```

* Add that file to your Project and your project should look like this

* Select _splash\_logo.bk2_ and Open in Explorer (now you have the location where you are going to put the new video file that will replace the original one)
* Copy your own converted video in this location and replace the original one
* Close the Window and go back to WolvenKit and save you changes
* Now you are ready to either Install the Mod or Pack it and use it later \

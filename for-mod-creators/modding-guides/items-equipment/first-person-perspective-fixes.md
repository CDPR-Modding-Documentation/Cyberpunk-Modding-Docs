# First Person Perspective Fixes

**Published:** October 08 2023 by [FronkenZeepa](https://app.gitbook.com/u/pj9Ccv6IrMVhmNUW9HVbn6CYZ2B2 "mention")\
**Last documented update:** February 18 2024 by [manavortex](https://app.gitbook.com/u/NfZBoxGegfUqB33J9HXuCs6PVaC3 "mention")

In this guide, I will do my best to address the most common first person issues I've seen, and how to fix them.&#x20;

## **Prerequisite and other relevant Guides**

This guide assumes that you have an already working in-game item, and at least a basic understanding of WolvenKit.

* [WolvenKit](https://wiki.redmodding.org/wolvenkit/readme)
* [Adding new items](https://wiki.redmodding.org/cyberpunk-2077-modding/for-mod-creators/modding-guides/items-equipment/adding-new-items)
* [File Formats](https://wiki.redmodding.org/cyberpunk-2077-modding/for-mod-creators/files-and-what-they-do/file-formats)
* [Exporting and importing meshes](https://wiki.redmodding.org/cyberpunk-2077-modding/for-mod-creators/3d-modelling/exporting-and-importing-meshes)

{% hint style="warning" %}
To implement anything in this guide, you will need [a Wolvenkit project](https://app.gitbook.com/s/-MP\_ozZVx2gRZUPXkd4r/wolvenkit-app/usage/wolvenkit-projects) with the mod's files. You already have that if you're fixing your own mod (hopefully). If not, check out this guide on how to [analyze other mods!](https://wiki.redmodding.org/cyberpunk-2077-modding/for-mod-creators/modding-guides/analysing-other-mods)
{% endhint %}

### Index

* [Your sleeves render behind your arms](first-person-perspective-fixes.md#problem-1-your-sleeves-render-behind-your-arms)
* [Head/Face/Glasses/Mask/Helmet visible and obstructing vision](first-person-perspective-fixes.md#problem-2-head-face-glasses-mask-helmet-visible-and-obstructing-vision.)
* [You only need to hide a certain part of the clothing, like the collar/fur/stitching](first-person-perspective-fixes.md#problem-3-you-only-need-to-hide-a-certain-part-of-the-clothing-like-the-collar-fur-stitching.)

{% hint style="warning" %}
**If you are modifying someone else's mod**:

If you are changing someone else's mod, the easiest thing is to [name your Wolvenkit project](https://app.gitbook.com/s/-MP\_ozZVx2gRZUPXkd4r/wolvenkit-app/usage/wolvenkit-projects#project-naming-and-mod-load-order) the same as the mod's `.archive` file and add all the files from the original mod. You can do that by switching to the [Mod Browser](https://app.gitbook.com/s/-MP\_ozZVx2gRZUPXkd4r/wolvenkit-app/editor/asset-browser#mod-browser) and [searching](https://app.gitbook.com/s/-MP\_ozZVx2gRZUPXkd4r/wolvenkit-app/usage/wolvenkit-search-finding-files) for `archive:name_of_file`&#x20;

For more information on this, read [here](recolours-and-refits/r-and-r-your-own-wolvenkit-project.md#a-full-repack).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
If you're creating a fix for someone else's asset, why not drop them the final files - or a link to this guide?
{% endhint %}

## Problem #1: Your sleeves render _behind_ your arms

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (198).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>(This can also present itself as rendering behind the body when you look down, for shirts, pants, shoes, etc.)</p></figcaption></figure>

This is probably the most common problem I've seen, and is also thankfully the easiest to fix.

### Solution

1.  Open up the [mesh entity](../../files-and-what-they-do/entity-.ent-files/#mesh-component-entity-simple-entity) (`.ent`) file for the item you need to fix:

    <figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (268).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>There are no appearances in a mesh entity file!</p></figcaption></figure>
2.  Expand the `components` array, then find any `component`s with `Mesh` in their types, and check if they require fixing. In my example project, it's both the jacket and the sleeves.&#x20;

    <figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (269).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>You might have to hunt around to find the right component, depending on how many there are.</p></figcaption></figure>
3.  Scroll down and find the array `renderingPlaneAnimationParam`_,_ which will most likely be grayed out.

    <figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (270).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
4.  Click on it. In the right pane, change `None` to renderPlane.

    <figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (271).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Make sure to follow the same capitalization, otherwise it won't work!</p></figcaption></figure>
5. Repeat this process for any other component, as needed
6. When finished, save the file (either Ctrl + S or the Save button top left).
7.  Install and test the mod in-game. If you did it correctly, your sleeves should now render properly.

    <figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (272).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Oh look, sleeves!</p></figcaption></figure>



## Problem #2: It's in your face (#justStormtrooperThings)

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (273).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Still better than wearing a <em>real</em> helmet.</p></figcaption></figure>

To fix this problem, you need to **hide** your item in first person perspective.&#x20;

This part of the guide will show you how to turn the entire item invisible. If you don't want that, check [#problem-3-partial-hiding-justdraculathings](first-person-perspective-fixes.md#problem-3-partial-hiding-justdraculathings "mention")

### Solution

1. This fix starts in the `.yaml` file (which should live under your Wolvenkit project's `resources` folder in the subfolder `r6/tweaks`, perhaps in a subfolder).
   * If you are editing someone else's mod, you need to copy their `.yaml` to your project. If you don't know which file that is, check their Nexus mod files, as it will be part of the original .zip file.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you don't have a yaml because you're changing an in-game item for some reason, you need to start at [#fixing-the-root-entity](first-person-perspective-fixes.md#fixing-the-root-entity "mention"). If you [convert it to a dynamic appearance](adding-new-items/archivexl-dynamic-variants.md#the-root\_entity), you can stick to these parts in the rest of the guide.
{% endhint %}

2. Open the file in any text editor (recommended: [**Notepad++**](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/))
3.  Helpful documentation on .yaml files resides [here](https://wiki.redmodding.org/cyberpunk-2077-modding/for-mod-creators/modding-guides/items-equipment/adding-new-items/archive-xl-item-structure-explained#the-control-file-yourmodname.yaml). Hopefully it looks something like this:

    <figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (274).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>This is my example .yaml file with only <em>one</em> entry. Yours might have more.</p></figcaption></figure>
4. Check if there is something called `$instances`. If yes, the mod is using [archivexl-dynamic-variants.md](adding-new-items/archivexl-dynamic-variants.md "mention") and you are done here â€” go to [#dynamic-variants-hiding-fpp](first-person-perspective-fixes.md#dynamic-variants-hiding-fpp "mention")
5. Find the line `appearanceSuffixes`_. **Again,**_ If the mod is using [archivexl-dynamic-variants.md](adding-new-items/archivexl-dynamic-variants.md "mention") (there is something called $instances), you can skip this step.
6. If the line isn't there, add it. Use the same number of leading spaces as in the surrounding lines!
7.  Add the line `itemsFactoryAppearanceSuffix.Camera` to the array. If you have something else in there, add a comma.

    <figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (275).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>If there's already another entry, add a comma and a space, <em>then</em> add <code>itemsFactoryAppearanceSuffix.Camera</code>.</p></figcaption></figure>
8. Repeat this process for any other items in the `.yaml` that you need to fix.&#x20;
9. Save and close the file.

### Legacy variants: hiding FPP

{% hint style="info" %}
For dynamic appearances (if the yaml has a key called `$instances`), go to [#dynamic-variants-hiding-fpp](first-person-perspective-fixes.md#dynamic-variants-hiding-fpp "mention")
{% endhint %}

1. Switch back to Wolvenkit.
2. Open the [root entity (.ent)](../../files-and-what-they-do/entity-.ent-files/#root-entity) file (it should have an array called `appearances`)

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (276).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You now have two ways of hiding the item in first person:

#### Hiding FPP via tag

{% hint style="warning" %}
This will not work with [archivexl-dynamic-variants.md](adding-new-items/archivexl-dynamic-variants.md "mention")!
{% endhint %}

1. Find the array `tags` at the end of the list.
2. In the panel on the right, click "add new item" (the yellow +) until you have an empt text field.
3. In the text field, enter `EmptyAppearance:FPP`

#### Hiding FPP via appearance definition

1. Find and expand the `appearances` array.&#x20;
2.  For each entry in there, you need to complete the following steps (the example project has only one entry).

    1. Select each entry
    2. Duplicate it via right-click menu
    3. For the old entry: Change its `name` to end in `&TPP` (third person perspective)
    4. For the new entry:&#x20;
       1. Change the `name` to end in `&FPP` (first person camera)
       2. Change the depotPath to `base\characters\appearances\player\items\empty_appearance.app`
       3. change the `appearanceName` to `default`

    <figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/first_person_appearance_suffixes.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Should look like this now.</p></figcaption></figure>

### Dynamic variants: Hiding FPP

{% hint style="info" %}
For legacy appearances (if the yaml does not have a key called `$instances`), go to [#legacy-variants-hiding-fpp](first-person-perspective-fixes.md#legacy-variants-hiding-fpp "mention")
{% endhint %}

1. Switch back to Wolvenkit.
2. Pick **one of the two** options below (we recommend[#hiding-fpp-in-the-.app](first-person-perspective-fixes.md#hiding-fpp-in-the-.app "mention"))

#### Hiding FPP in the .app

1. Open the [.app file](../../files-and-what-they-do/appearance-.app-files/) in Wolvenkit
2. Open the `appearances` array
3. Select each appearance and add `&camera=tpp` to the name.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (261).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### Hiding FPP in the mesh\_entity

1. Open the [#mesh-component-entity-simple-entity](../../files-and-what-they-do/entity-.ent-files/#mesh-component-entity-simple-entity "mention") in Wolvenkit
2. Open the `components` array
3. Select each component with `Mesh` in its type and add `&camera=tpp` to the name

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/fixiing_fpp_dynamic_mesh_entity.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
Alternatively, you can duplicate the component and have two for different meshes. This will be covered in [#problem-3-partial-hiding-justdraculathings](first-person-perspective-fixes.md#problem-3-partial-hiding-justdraculathings "mention")
{% endhint %}

### Testing

Save and close the file. Repeat the whole process for any other items that need to be obliterated in first person. Install and test. If all went well, no more obstructed vision!

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (279).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>I can see clearly now!</p></figcaption></figure>

## Problem #3: Partial hiding (#justDraculaThings)

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (280).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>I probably could have chosen a better example, but I'm sure you can see the big clump of fur on the right.</p></figcaption></figure>

Fixing this is very similar to Problem #2, just with a few extra steps.



### Solution

1. Create an additional FPP appearance by following the steps in [#hiding-fpp-via-appearance-definition](first-person-perspective-fixes.md#hiding-fpp-via-appearance-definition "mention"). **Skip 2.4.3 and 2.4.4**.&#x20;
2. The `depotPath` should point at the same .app file as the \&TPP appearance.
3. Change the value for appearanceName. For example, add \_fpp

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/first_person_root_ent_app.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

4. Open your .app file and expand the `appearances` array.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
You need to repeat the following steps for every appearance in the .app.
{% endhint %}

5. Select an appearance and duplicate it
6. Change its `name` to correspond to the `appearanceName` that you used in your root entity (Step 3)

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/first_person_fixes_app.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

At this point, it can be done in a few ways, depending on some factors:

#### Finding the right submesh

1. Open up the appearance's `partsValue` array
2. Open the .ent file that is linked inside
3.  In the .ent file, open the `components` array and check any component with Mesh in its name:\


    <figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (269).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>You might have to hunt around to find the right component, depending on how many there are.</p></figcaption></figure>
4. Open the linked .mesh file in Wolvenkit
5. Select `Mesh Preview`&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (281).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>My example mesh, a lovely fur collar.</p></figcaption></figure>

6. In the right-hand panel, you will see a list of checkboxes.

{% hint style="info" %}
If there is only one submesh, you need to edit it in Blender to split off or delete the offending parts - complete the section [#creating-a-second-.mesh](first-person-perspective-fixes.md#creating-a-second-.mesh "mention") before proceeding. I'll wait.
{% endhint %}

7. Toggle them off until the part that is in your face turns invisible. In my example, submesh 01 hides the upper collar.
8. Remember the number (01 in the example below)

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (282).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

9. Proceed to the section for [_Chunk Masks_](first-person-perspective-fixes.md#chunk-masks)_._

### Chunk Masks

{% hint style="info" %}
You can learn more about chunk masks under [3d-objects-.mesh-files](../../files-and-what-they-do/3d-objects-.mesh-files/ "mention") -> [submeshes-materials-and-chunks.md](../../files-and-what-they-do/3d-objects-.mesh-files/submeshes-materials-and-chunks.md "mention"). This is not necessary for the purpose of this guide.
{% endhint %}

1. Switch back to the appearance (.app) file&#x20;
2. Expand your first person appearance.
3. Expand the `partsOverrides` array. If it's empty, click on the array itself, then in the right pane, click create item in array.
4. Select `componentsOverrides` by clicking on it.&#x20;
5. In the right panel, click on the yellow + to create a new item in array.&#x20;
6. Open up the mesh entity (.ent) file and expand the `components` array.&#x20;
7.  Find the component that needs its parts hidden and copy the name. In my example, the component is `examplejacket1_fur`_._

    <figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (284).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
8.  Back to the appearance (.app) file. Paste the component's name from the mesh entity into the _`componentName`_ field.

    <figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (285).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
9. Click on `chunkMask` and uncheck the submeshes that you want to hide. (You found out which ones that were in [#finding-the-right-submesh](first-person-perspective-fixes.md#finding-the-right-submesh "mention") - In my example it was submesh 01)

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (286).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

10. **Optional**: If you need to hide more parts or affect more components/meshes, rinse and repeat.
11. Save the appearance (.app) file and install the mod to test. If all went well, there should no longer be parts clipping into view.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (287).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Results may vary depending on the item, but this is much better, no?</p></figcaption></figure>

### Creating a second mesh

{% hint style="info" %}
The clean way to do this is to split the original mesh into submeshes, which you can then hide via chunkmasks. If you want to do that, skip straight to [#editing-the-.mesh](first-person-perspective-fixes.md#editing-the-.mesh "mention")
{% endhint %}

To show a different item (one with the clipping bits removed) in first person perspective, we need to create a second .mesh file and a corresponding meshentity .ent that we can display. This guide will show you how.

1. Duplicate the `.mesh` file that's clipping in first person. For my example, I'm using the jacket mesh
2. Duplicate the meshentity `.ent` file that belongs to the `.mesh` file.
3. Change their names to end in \_fpp to indicate that this is a mesh for the **first person perspective** (or do whatever you want, but this guide assumes...)
4.

    <figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/files.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
5. In the `.app` file, open your first person appearance.&#x20;
6. Add a `partsOverride` by following the steps under [#chunk-masks](first-person-perspective-fixes.md#chunk-masks "mention") (skip step 9)
7. Change the depotPath to your new \_fpp meshentity file.&#x20;
8.

    <figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/app.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
9. Save and close the .app â€“ it is now pointing at  your new \_fpp meshentity.
10. In the \_fpp meshentity file, open the components array&#x20;
11. Select the component with Mesh in its name, open it and change the depotPath for the mesh to your new \_fpp mesh file.
12.

    <figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/ent.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>


13. Save and close the .ent - it is now pointing at your \_fpp mesh.

### Editing the .mesh

For the next step, we need to export our .mesh file and edit it. You can use any 3d editing program, but this guide will use  [Blender 3.6](https://www.blender.org/download/)  and the [wolvenkit-blender-io-suite](../../modding-tools/wolvenkit-blender-io-suite/ "mention").&#x20;

1. Optional, but recommended: If you don't have the [wolvenkit-blender-io-suite](../../modding-tools/wolvenkit-blender-io-suite/ "mention") installed, do that now.
2. In Wolvenkit, find the [Export Tool](https://app.gitbook.com/s/-MP\_ozZVx2gRZUPXkd4r/wolvenkit-app/usage/import-export)
3. Export your \_fpp .mesh file.
   * If the export throws an error, uncheck the Export Materials option in the settings panel (you don't need it)
4. You now have a `.glb` file in your project's `raw` folder. You can find it like this:
   1. Switch the Project Explorer to the `source` or `raw` tab&#x20;
   2. Right-click on your exported file
   3. Select the option to show it in Windows Explorer

Now, hit up the [3d-editing-submeshes.md](../../3d-modelling/3d-editing-submeshes.md "mention") page and edit your mesh.&#x20;

When you are done, use the [Wolvenkit Import Tool](https://app.gitbook.com/s/-MP\_ozZVx2gRZUPXkd4r/wolvenkit-app/tools/tools-import-export#import-tool) to import back the .glb file.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/first_person_fixes_1.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
If you stuck to the guide, you shouldn't run into any errors. If you do, check the [troubleshooting-your-mesh-edits.md](../../3d-modelling/troubleshooting-your-mesh-edits.md "mention") page, or reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/redmodding) in `#mod-dev-chat.`

# Sound

{% hint style="danger" %}
Oh no! There are no guides here! But maybe you are the person to change this?

Feel free to sign up and add your knowledge to the wiki. It doesn't matter if the guide is shitty or if your English is bad, the next person can always improve on your stuff – as long as there is any stuff!
{% endhint %}

There are a couple of pages about sounds on Roms1383s wiki for his Addicted Mod:

# ArchiveXL: Dynamic conversion guide

## Summary

**Last documented update:** June 30 2024 by [mana vortex](https://app.gitbook.com/u/NfZBoxGegfUqB33J9HXuCs6PVaC3 "mention")

This page will teach you how to convert your existing ArchiveXL mod to the "new" system.

## Prerequisites

* An ArchiveXL mod that you want to convert

We will go through the process step-by-step. I'll explain what I'm doing as I go along.

## Step 0: The .yaml

Instead of one entry per **item variant**, we only need one entry per **item**.&#x20;

Our variants are defined via `$instances` and generated via substitutions. Let's take a look at this:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/archivexl_conversion_yaml_before_after.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
You'll notice that the `displayName`s are different now. I could prevent that by writing `my_shirt_localization_name_$(shirt)_$(ribbons)`, but this is a great chance to clean up the historically-grown mess.
{% endhint %}

### What did we do here?

* We **deleted** the `appearanceSuffixes` (we'd only need them for [gendered-preview-icons.md](../../../modding-guides/custom-icons-and-ui/adding-items-preview-images/gendered-preview-icons.md "mention"), and we can't be arsed with that)
* We defined a list of `$instances`, which will generate all of our different appearances
* We replaced all parts that are different with the corresponding key from `$instances`. The rest will be magic.

### And that !+ stuff?

Defines the variants — you'll get a gold star for paying attention, but we're getting to that later ([#step-3-the-mesh-entity](archivexl-dynamic-conversion-guide.md#step-3-the-mesh-entity "mention"))

## Step 1: The root entity

Instead of one entry **per variant and gender**, we only need one entry **in total**.&#x20;

Our appearance's `name` must still match the `.yaml`, but only up to the variant separator: we're going with `appearance_root_entity_`.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/archivexl_conversion_root_entity_before_after.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
By leaving the `appearanceName` blank, we're telling ArchiveXL to re-use `name`.  If you want to use a specific appearance name (or if you don't want `appearance_root_entity_` in your .app), you can put something different here.
{% endhint %}

### What did we do here?

* We added the `DynamicAppearance` tag to enable the feature
* We deleted all appearances but one
* We deleted everything variant-related from the appearance
* We deleted the appearanceName, so that ArchiveXL will re-use `name` for the .app

## Step 2: The .app

Instead of one appearance per **variant and gender**, we will squash everything down so that we have only one appearance per gender. In [#lets-simplify-this-even-further](archivexl-dynamic-conversion-guide.md#lets-simplify-this-even-further "mention"), I will teach you how to reduce that even further, but for now, we'll be going step by step.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/archivexl_conversion_app_file_before_after.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### What did we do here?

* We deleted all but one appearance per gender
* We added the condition `&gender=w` and `&gender=m`
* We deleted the `partsOverrides`

Gender matching now happens via condition. The different meshes for male and female body gender are loaded in the different mesh entity files.

{% hint style="info" %}
For a full list of conditions, see [archivexl-suffixes-and-substitutions.md](../../../for-mod-creators/core-mods-explained/archivexl/archivexl-suffixes-and-substitutions.md "mention")
{% endhint %}

### But that will always load the default appearance!

Right! You've been paying attention! Let's take a look at that next.

## Step 3: The mesh entity

We will only change a single field (`meshAppearance`).&#x20;

Before, it was `mesh_white_red` (the default appearance), and each appearance overwrote it via `partsOverride`. We're now changing it to `dynamic`:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/archivexl_conversion_mesh_entity.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Old: `mesh_white_red`\
New:  `*mesh_{variant.2}_{variant.1}`

{% hint style="info" %}
This is where file validation currently stops working (as of June 2024). If you make any mistakes here, you will always see the first mesh appearance.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
This assumes that the appearance names inside the mesh start with the prefix `mesh_`. If yours don't, you need to adjust accordingly.
{% endhint %}

### What did we just do?

* By adding a leading `*`, we told ArchiveXL that this field is involved in magic (substitution in this case)
* By replacing `white` with `{variant.2}`, we're using the second parameter from the yaml's `appearanceName` (shirt).  &#x20;
* By replacing `red` with `{variant.1}`, we're using the first parameter from the yaml's `appearanceName` (ribbons).  &#x20;

### Parameters? Variants? What?

Let's unpack this.

In this example, we have the following mesh appearances:&#x20;

* `mesh_white_red`
* `mesh_black_red`
* `mesh_black_blue`

By using `!` in the `appearanceName`, we're telling ArchiveXL that everything after is part of the mesh appearance definition:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/archivexl_conversion_guide_variants.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
This is the reason why we've used only `appearance_root_entity_` as the appearanceName, and not the whole ordeal.
{% endhint %}

The `+` in the `variant` allows you to reference each substitution by its index. In this case, `variant.1` is the first element (before the `+`), `variant.2` (after the `+`), and if you wanted more substitution variables, you could add more `+` and reference `variant.3`, `variant.4`, etc.

#### What if I don't use +?

Let's compare our setup ( `*mesh_{variant.2}_{variant.1}`)  to the alternative.

yaml:&#x20;

```yaml
appearanceName: appearance_root_entity!$(shirt)_$(ribbons)
```

Our `meshAppearance` would be `*mesh_{variant}`.

{% hint style="info" %}
Without the split, there's no way to reference the individual substitutions.
{% endhint %}

## Recap

Unless you got hopelessly lost, this should have taken no more than ten minutes, and your mod just works(tm).&#x20;

You now have one `root_entity` entry,  two `appearanceAppearanceDefinition`s in your `.app`, and one `mesh_entity` per body gender.

## Let's simplify this even further.

Currently, we have two mesh\_entities:&#x20;

```
tutorial\torso\my_custom_shirt\mesh_entity_pwa.ent
tutorial\torso\my_custom_shirt\mesh_entity_pma.ent
```

Each of them points at a different mesh:

```
tutorial\torso\my_custom_shirt\meshes\t1_custom_shirt_pwa.mesh
tutorial\torso\my_custom_shirt\meshes\t1_custom_shirt_pma.mesh
```

Delete one of the mesh entities and rename the other:

```
tutorial\torso\my_custom_shirt\mesh_entity.ent
```

### The .app file

Delete one of your appearances, and strip the suffix name from the other, leaving only `appearance_root_entity_`.

Change the path of your `partsValue` to the only remaining mesh entity, and save the file.

{% hint style="info" %}
This will only load one body gender (the one you defined in the `mesh_entity`).
{% endhint %}

## The mesh\_entity: Round 2

### Method 1: Conditional Components

{% hint style="danger" %}
You should use the other approach where possible; this is only documented here for the sake of completeness.
{% endhint %}

Just like with appearances, you can also use [#conditions](../../../for-mod-creators/core-mods-explained/archivexl/archivexl-suffixes-and-substitutions.md#conditions "mention") with component names.

**Pro:** Especially with many body mods, you can just put all the logic into the components

**Cons:** All of these components will be added to the player entity, even if half of them will be hidden. This is bad for performance, especially if everyone does it.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you want several different body mods or feet state to use the same mesh, you can use [archivexl-resource-linking.md](archivexl-resource-linking.md "mention") instead.
{% endhint %}

### Method 2: Component substitution

The best way of dealing with multiple meshes is to have a single component and let ArchiveXL handle all the heavy lifting by using substitutions in the path:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/archivexl_conversion_path_substitution.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This is our mesh's depot path:

```
*tutorial\torso\my_custom_shirt\meshes\t1_custom_shirt_p{gender}a.mesh
```

At runtime, ArchiveXL will substitute `{gender}` with `w` or `m`, so depending on your V's body gender, the game will load one of these paths:&#x20;

```
tutorial\torso\my_custom_shirt\meshes\t1_custom_shirt_pwa.mesh
tutorial\torso\my_custom_shirt\meshes\t1_custom_shirt_pma.mesh
```

You can find a full list of component substitution on [archivexl-suffixes-and-substitutions.md](../../../for-mod-creators/core-mods-explained/archivexl/archivexl-suffixes-and-substitutions.md "mention").

<details>

<summary>Instead of body gender, you can also use this for <strong>body mods</strong>: </summary>

<pre><code><strong>*tutorial\torso\my_custom_shirt\meshes\t1_custom_shirt__{body}.mesh
</strong></code></pre>

becomes

```
tutorial\torso\my_custom_shirt\meshes\t1_custom_shirt__base_body.mesh
tutorial\torso\my_custom_shirt\meshes\t1_custom_shirt__lush.mesh
tutorial\torso\my_custom_shirt\meshes\t1_custom_shirt__ebbwtfbbq.mesh
...and many more
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Wolvenkit ≥ 8.16.2 lets you convert paths to dynamic from editor panel's context menu  (to the right of the tree view)
{% endhint %}

#### That's it!

By using substitutions, your mesh path will auto-adjust to the current circumstances, and simply load the correct mesh.

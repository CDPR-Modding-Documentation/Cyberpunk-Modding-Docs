# Cheat Sheet: Vehicle Properties

## Summary

This page lists those properties that control how a vehicle behaves. By changing/tweaking them, you can modify a vehicle's behaviour.

Legend:
* An explanation that begins with (?) needs verifying.
* A value range that is filled with a dash '-' indicates either that:
** The value range is open for experimentation as there are no specific, known limitations, or
** That the value range is inferrable, e.g. a boolean or a TweakDBID.
** Unknown fields have a question mark, '?', as content.

N.B. Descriptions of the properties are conclusions of multiple contributors' trial and error process. While the best effort was done to identify and describe completely and accurately what those properties mean and how to work with them, there is no guarantee of it being so.

### Wait, this is not what I want!

* For a guide on **adding** vehicles, see [boe6s-guide-new-car-from-a-to-z](../../../modding-guides/vehicles/boe6s-guide-new-car-from-a-to-z/ "mention")
* For a guide on how to visually change base game vehicles, see [altering-appearances-within-wolvenkit-full-workflow.md](../../../modding-guides/npcs/appearances-change-the-looks/altering-appearances-within-wolvenkit-full-workflow.md "mention") (the process is the same for cars)
* If you want to know how to change an existing car, check [tweak-modding-guides.md](../../tweaks/tweak-modding-guides.md "mention"), for example [adding-stats-and-modifiers.md](../../../modding-guides/items-equipment/editing-existing-items/adding-stats-and-modifiers.md "mention")

## Vehicle Records: Performance

The root of vehicle data and information is under the gamedataVehicle_Record, and those entries generally follow the name pattern `Vehicle.{vehicle_name}`. Below is a high-level sketch of the tree of this structure, insofar relevant for the vehicle performance. Here is [the full overview](../../../for-mod-creators-theory/references-lists-and-overviews/vehicles/vehicle-record.md).

### gamedataVehicleEngineData_Record

| Property | Data Type | Value Range | Sample Value  | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| engineMaxTorque | float | - | 700.0 | Maximum engine torque. A lower value will lead to an engine that has to work harder to move the vehicle, and might be the limiting factor for the vehicle's top speed. A higher value means more engine power, but might cause instability when on throttle. |
| fastR1GearChange | boolean | - | true | |
| finalGearTorqueDecimationScalor | float | - | 1.0 | |
| flyWheelMomentOfInertia | float | - | 0.3 | The coefficient of the flywheel interia. A lower value means more ease in gaining or losing speed. Vice versa vor a higher value and a slower gain or decrease of speed. |

| minRPM | float | &ge; 0 | 800.0 | Minimum engine RPM. Beware of this setting in relation with the gears information. If the gear information suggests that a lower RPM is needed to stop the car than minRPM, stopping the car might become a non-straightforward thing. |
| resistanceTorque | float | - | 100.0 | The decrease in torque with during throttle lift-off. A negative number will result in likely unwanted acceleration. Zero will render this effect neutral. |
| reverseDirDelay | float | &ge; 0 | 0.3 | The time (in seconds) it takes to switch from braking to car moving in reverse direction. A lesser value will allow the to start going in reverse sooner, a greater value will make it less likely to inadvertently start moving in reverse. |
| wheelsResistanceRatio | float | - | 15.0 | |

#### gamedataVehicleGearRecord

Each of items of this type represent **one** gear of a vehicle. A vehicle will typically have multiple hears. They are stored in its engine data as an array.

**Rework:** in April 2025 by [martine-dee](https://github.com/martine-dee). While this encompasses so much more than the Drive Model, it gives a comprehensive overview in line with the original intent to show 'All the properties that make your car go fast (or slow)'. My strong suggestion is to DO keep this information in one page as a single-stop with all information.

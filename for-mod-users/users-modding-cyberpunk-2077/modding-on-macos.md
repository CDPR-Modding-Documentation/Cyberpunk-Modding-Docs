### Modding Support on MacOS (or Lack Thereof)

At the time of writing, the only framework mod that is unofficially supported on the MacOS build of Cyberpunk 2077 is [redscript](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-MP5ijqI11FeeX7c8-N8/s/-McniwB8YOK2HnJ7SYg_/) starting with the 0.5.29 build. As such, the only mods that are supported on MacOS are pure **redscript-only** mods (i.e. no Codeware, no ArchiveXL, etc.)

Additionally, due to the security features built into MacOS, modding the game is possible, but much more annoying. You'll get a lot of scary-looking warnings and permission requests, but this is normal. Don't worry! We'll go through all of them here.

## Getting Started

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
#### Download redscript for macOS

Find the latest release on the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/jac3km4/redscript/releases/) for redscript

{% hint style="warning" %}
Be sure to download `redscript-vX.X.XX-macos.zip` , NOT `redscript-cli-aarch64-darwin` !
{% endhint %}
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Install redscript to your game directory

Copy the contents of the zip/folder to your Cyberpunk 2077 install folder (the one with `Cyberpunk2077.app`). The default locations can be found here:

* Steam: `~/Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/common/Cyberpunk 2077/`
* Non-Steam (e.g. GOG or AppStore): `/Applications/Cyberpunk 2077/`
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Unblock redscript in macOS

Open the Terminal app and run the following command to tell MacOS redscript is safe to run:

* Steam:

```bash
xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine "~/Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/common/Cyberpunk 2077/engine/tools/"
```

* Non-Steam (e.g. GOG or AppStore):

```bash
xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Cyberpunk 2077/engine/tools/"
```
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Download input loader for macOS

Find the latest release on the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/risner/cyberpunk2077-input-loader-mac/releases/) for redscript
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Install input loader to your game directory

Copy the contents of the zip/folder to your Cyberpunk 2077 install folder (the one with `Cyberpunk2077.app`). The default locations can be found here:

* Steam: `~/Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/common/Cyberpunk 2077/`
* Non-Steam (e.g. GOG or AppStore): `/Applications/Cyberpunk 2077/`
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Make sure your script is executable

```bash
chmod +x "/Applications/Cyberpunk 2077/launch_modded.sh"
```
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

## Running Cyberpunk 2077 on macOS with redscript

The MacOS build of Cyberpunk 2077 will not start redscript automatically like the Windows build. Therefore, any redscript mods you install will not be included in the game automatically, but you don't have to run the script every time, only with new mods or updates **to let them compile**. You have three options:

### 1. Link bash script to your game client

_a) Steam:_

**TODO:** Steam is tricky one, as it doesn't allow to pick custom executable. Main idea is to rename original executable `Cyberpunk2077` to `Cyberpunk2077_real`, then renaming `launch_modded.sh` script to executable-like file, adjusting the code to call actual executable after redscript is compiled and finally making it recognize-able for macOS as such. If you find it hard, use option two or three, by running it manually with every new mod or every time.

1. Rename the executable inside `Cyberpunk2077.app` :

```bash
mv "~/Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/common/Cyberpunk 2077/Cyberpunk2077.app/Contents/MacOS/Cyberpunk2077" "~/Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/common/Cyberpunk 2077/Cyberpunk2077.app/Contents/MacOS/Cyberpunk2077_real"
```

2. Using preferable text editor (use `Text Edit`, if you don't have any), adjust `launch_modded.sh` to our changes:

* Locate following line:

```bash
"$game_dir/Cyberpunk2077.app/Contents/MacOS/Cyberpunk2077" "$@"
```

* Replace it with following:

```bash
"$game_dir/Cyberpunk2077.app/Contents/MacOS/Cyberpunk2077.real" "$@"
```

* Save the file with `Command` + `S` .

3. Rename the launch script to executable:

```bash
mv "~/Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/common/Cyberpunk 2077/launch_modded.sh" "~/Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/common/Cyberpunk 2077/Cyberpunk2077"
```

4. Make sure it's executable:

<pre class="language-bash"><code class="lang-bash"><strong>chmod +X "~/Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/common/Cyberpunk 2077/Cyberpunk2077"
</strong></code></pre>

_b) GOG:_

1. Launch GOG Galaxy ‚Üí **Cyberpunk 2077 ‚Üí More ‚Üí Manage Installation ‚Üí Configure ‚Üí Add another executable / arguments**
2.  Locate the game path and ensure to select the script

    ```
    /Applications/Cyberpunk 2077/launch_modded.sh
    ```
3. Press **Select an executable to link,** ensure **Default executable** is **checked** and press **OK**.

Now GOG Galaxy will run your script whenever you press **Play**.

c) App Store

Manually launch the script every time or with every new mod installed.

### 2. Run the Included Bash Script to Start Cyberpunk 2077

* From Finder, double click the `launch_modded.sh` file in the `Cyberpunk 2077` folder

or

* From Terminal, `cd` to your Cyberpunk 2077 folder (the same as before) and run `./launch_modded.sh`

### 3. Manually run redscript, then launch the game normally

# MO2 (Mod Organizer 2)

{% hint style="warning" %}
With the release of <mark style="color:orange;">**Update 2.12**</mark> for **Cyberpunk 2077** and **Mod Organizer **<mark style="color:orange;">**2.5**</mark>, the installation process has been modified. To ensure everything works smoothly, please review the updated instructions below and adjust your installation procedures accordingly
{% endhint %}

MO2 (**Mod Organizer 2**, [Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6194?tab=files) | [Github](https://github.com/ModOrganizer2/modorganizer/releases))Â is a free, widely-used mod manager, especially popular for Bethesda games like Skyrim or Fallout. It fully supports **Cyberpunk 2077** and is praised for its ease of use.&#x20;

Using MO2 keeps your base game directory untouched and allows for easy mod installation, uninstallation, and updating. Additionally, you can create different profiles for mod configurations.

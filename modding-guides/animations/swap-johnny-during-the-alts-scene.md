First off, grab my FixSwap and Removers mods and drop them in your Mod Folder

Load your “Never Fade Away” save file before entering the room, and open AMM

**Spawn > At Own Risk > Johnny mirror**

The spawned Johnny will be **invisible,** you’ll need to scan his feet shadow to be able to swap!

Make a quick save and reload it

Make sure to **despawn** your V/Johnny before entering the room!

There will be small a moment, when Alt takes off Johnny’s glasses, where your V will turn invisible ; That’s ok, they’ll pop right back when the mirror scene start!

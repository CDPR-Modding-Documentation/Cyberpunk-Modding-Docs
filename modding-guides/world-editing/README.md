# üåê World Editing

This page will introduce you to the very basic structure of the world and the necessary tools to effectively modify the surroundings to your liking.

### World Structure

The world of Cyberpunk2077 consists of [nodes](../../for-mod-creators-theory/references-lists-and-overviews/reference-world-sectors/reference-.streamingsector-node-types.md), which can represent anything from visible meshes, collision, lights, effects to sounds, areas dictating where NPCs can spawn and more. These are grouped together into `streamingsector`'s which are packed inside the archive files of the game. Thus, directly editing them is not possible without causing conflicts (This is relevant for deleting and modifying nodes). To avoid that, ArchiveXL allows working with streamingsectors in a non-destructible way.

Additions to the world are also made possible by ArchiveXL, which can tell the game to load custom streamingsectors.

### Tools You Will Need

* **ArchiveXL (**[**Nexus**](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4198)**|**[**Wiki**](https://wiki.redmodding.org/cyberpunk-2077-modding/for-mod-creators-theory/core-mods-explained/archivexl)**):** In the context of world editing, ArchiveXL allows for the non-destructive modification of sector files (E.g. Removing or modifying nodes), and also handles the merging of custom streamingsectors into the game.
* **RedHotTools (**[**GitHub**](https://github.com/psiberx/cp2077-red-hot-tools)**|**[**Wiki**](https://wiki.redmodding.org/cyberpunk-2077-modding/for-mod-creators-theory/modding-tools/redhottools)**):** Allows for inspection of nodes and objects at runtime, providing you details like nodetype, nodeinstance, the sectorpath and more.

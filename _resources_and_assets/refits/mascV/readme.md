Info for using "ladylea_mascV_body_neck_skel_v2.mesh" (previously named LD_xBae_Johnson_MascV_Body_Neck_Skeleton.mesh)
UPDATED: 9 NOVEMBER 2025

=============================================

This version was updated using the latest WolvenKit Tools, the first version was created with Noesis and it was noted that there were issues with the bones positions, and now the bones should be applicable to MascV Player Body.

This MV template was created and based all thanks to Angy's template for Female V 'xbae_femV_body_neck_skel' found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qb6nTlPH4x7k9XOhjL2mm3DcR3UHTQSt/view)

A .blend file is also available, which contains the Default Masc Body and Gymfiend Body (+ clothes for reference) to transfer weights from.

=============================================

20 Submeshes sections are available to include various meshes into one mesh file

Multilayer = Mlsetup, Mlmask, Global Normal
PBR = Standard Textures (Albedo (plus alpha), Roughness, Metalness, Normal, Emission Mask)
Emission = Simple Emission over whole mesh
Glass = Used on half transparent surfaces ingame, apparently can be used with textures
Decal = Similar to PBR but gets projected onto the mesh underneath
Stitches = Loads game's standard textures used for stitches
HairFur = Standard hair shader also used for fur

=============================================

Nearly all materials have placeholder texture paths that do not exist.

Dummy textures to paste when you don't have certain textures:
engine\textures\editor\white.xbm
engine\textures\editor\black.xbm
engine\textures\editor\grey.xbm
engine\textures\editor\normal.xbm

=============================================
Paste these names to set your submesh materials.
Thanks to Johnson for the emission entry!
